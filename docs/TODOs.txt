TODOs

- Implement debugging tool. Neat feature: ip address check - only show debugging 
  messages when requests are from a specified ip address.

- Generate warning if include fails at all levels.

- Use naming scheme for helpers vs. getters. Example:
  url() -- prints url immediately
  get_url() -- get string containing url
