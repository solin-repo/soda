Soda For Moodle 2


Soda is a Moodle plugin to develop new modules. Soda does two things:

    - It constructs all your standard module functions dynamically: you don't 
      have to set up a complete lib.php file anymore for each new module.
    - Soda provides you with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for your 
      module, eliminating a lot of complexity.

Traditionally, all your standard module functions reside in a file called 
lib.php. They are prefixed with your module's name, e.g.: planner_get_instance.
Soda provides these functions for your new module and allows you to override 
their default behavior.

The MVC part of Soda makes it easier to separate layout (html) from business 
logic and default Moodle code.

In a Soda module, the business logic (validation rules and more) resides in a 
model (or several, if your module is "about" more than one topic). The layout
ends up in separate views. The flow of the application is handled by a 
controller class (usually one for each model class).

Then end result is a more maintainable and extensible Moodle module.


Please note: there are currently three branches:

* master - always contains the Soda module for the most recent version of Moodle
* moodle19 - Soda for Moodle 1.9
* moodle21 - Soda for Moodle 2.1


INSTALLATION

Place the soda directory in your Moodle's "local" directory. E.g.:
